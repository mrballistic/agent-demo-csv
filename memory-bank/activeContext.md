# Active Context

## Current Priority: Semantic Data Layer Implementation

### Problem Statement

Current system uses "throw everything at the LLM" approach:

- Sends entire CSV content directly to GPT-4 (up to 8MB after sampling)
- No data profiling pipeline or schema inference
- No statistical preprocessing or optimization
- No indexing for repeated queries
- Expensive token usage and slow response times

### Strategic Direction: Multi-Agent Semantic Layer

Implementing hybrid approach with specialized agents:

- **Data Profiling Agent**: Pre-compute schema, statistics, quality metrics
- **Query Planning Agent**: Translate natural language to optimized operations
- **Security Agent**: PII detection and data redaction
- **Chart Generation Agent**: Specialized visualization engine
- **Conversation Agent**: Context-aware follow-up handling

### Technical Approach

Following Kiro-Lite workflow: **PRD ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Code**

1. Define semantic layer requirements and success metrics
2. Design multi-agent architecture and data models
3. Break down into implementable tasks
4. Execute with continuous validation

### Implementation Status

#### Completed ‚úÖ

- EventSource connection stability fixes
- ReactMarkdown with GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- Stable useChat hook parameters preventing infinite re-renders
- OpenAI API key validation and testing
- **Silent fallback mechanism** (no user-facing errors)
- Enhanced error logging for debugging
- **Diagnostic framework** for OpenAI issue analysis

#### Current Investigation üîç

- Root cause analysis of OpenAI Assistant API failures
- Thread/file state management issues
- Code interpreter processing problems
- Assistant configuration optimization

### Diagnostic Framework

- `diagnoseOpenAIIssue()` - Systematic testing of OpenAI components
- Tests: Assistant creation, thread access, message creation, file handling, run execution
- Integrated into streaming pipeline for automatic root cause analysis

### Technical Architecture

- Next.js 14 with Server-Sent Events
- OpenAI Assistant API with code interpreter
- ReactMarkdown for message rendering
- Material-UI integration
- File upload and CSV analysis pipeline
- **Silent fallback to simulation** when OpenAI fails

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor diagnostic results** to identify specific failure patterns
2. **Investigate thread state** and file upload correlation with failures
3. **Optimize assistant configuration** based on diagnostic findings
4. **Consider alternative approaches** (direct chat completions vs assistant API)
