# Active Context

## Current Priority: OpenAI Streaming Issue Resolution

### Problem Statement

- OpenAI API is working (verified with test scripts) but returning "Sorry, something went wrong" server_error during Assistant API streaming
- Current fallback system shows error message to user before switching to simulation
- User wants seamless experience without showing "Analysis failed" message

### Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

- **Silent Fallback**: Modified `thread.run.failed` handler to NOT send failure event to client
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Created diagnostic tool to identify specific failure points
- **Root Cause Investigation**: Integrated diagnostics into streaming pipeline

### Technical Details

- OpenAI API key: Valid and working (chat completions and assistant creation successful)
- Issue: `thread.run.failed` events with server_error code during streaming
- **Fixed Behavior**: Silent fallback without showing error to user
- **Diagnostic Tool**: `src/lib/openai-diagnostics.ts` for systematic issue identification

### Implementation Status

#### Completed ‚úÖ

- EventSource connection stability fixes
- ReactMarkdown with GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- Stable useChat hook parameters preventing infinite re-renders
- OpenAI API key validation and testing
- **Silent fallback mechanism** (no user-facing errors)
- Enhanced error logging for debugging
- **Diagnostic framework** for OpenAI issue analysis

#### Current Investigation üîç

- Root cause analysis of OpenAI Assistant API failures
- Thread/file state management issues
- Code interpreter processing problems
- Assistant configuration optimization

### Diagnostic Framework

- `diagnoseOpenAIIssue()` - Systematic testing of OpenAI components
- Tests: Assistant creation, thread access, message creation, file handling, run execution
- Integrated into streaming pipeline for automatic root cause analysis

### Technical Architecture

- Next.js 14 with Server-Sent Events
- OpenAI Assistant API with code interpreter
- ReactMarkdown for message rendering
- Material-UI integration
- File upload and CSV analysis pipeline
- **Silent fallback to simulation** when OpenAI fails

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor diagnostic results** to identify specific failure patterns
2. **Investigate thread state** and file upload correlation with failures
3. **Optimize assistant configuration** based on diagnostic findings
4. **Consider alternative approaches** (direct chat completions vs assistant API)
